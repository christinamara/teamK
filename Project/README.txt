README:

In the teamk repo folder, there is a folder called Project.

All source code is found there.
To run the game, simply execute python3 command for the correct game:

python3 bartok.py
python3 crazyeights.py

Bartok is simple. Play a card of either the same number or suit as a valid move. Otherwise, you must draw a card. First to have no cards wins, or if the deck runs out the game ends.

Crazy eights is Bartok on steroids. Same game, but if you play an 8 you get to pick the suit that the next player has to match. Also, if the deck runs out, there is a scoring mechanism on the remaining cards per hand to calculate a winner. For the most part, scores are the same as the card number, but face cards are all 10 and an 8 card is worth 50.

When playing, type the card number of the card in hand you are playing, or D to draw a new card.


The runs/transcript logs are also found in the Project folder, inside a subfolder called Game Runs NEW. There are 2 runs for Bartok and 4 for crazy eights.
