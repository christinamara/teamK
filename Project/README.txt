README:

In the teamk repo folder, there is a folder called Project.

All source code is found there.
To run the game, simply execute python command: python game.py

What is implemented so far is that the player must make a move of either the same suit or number of card. Or they must draw. If a player runs out of cards they win, and if the deck finishes without a winner the game ends.

When playing the game, be sure to place ' ' around your inputs for moves.
Also, the 'D' for draw IS case sensitive.


The runs/transcript logs are also found in the Project folder, inside a subfolder called Game Runs. Runs 1, 2, and 4 are runs where a player wins. Run 3 was intentionally an instance of continuous draws to empty the deck and force the game to end.
